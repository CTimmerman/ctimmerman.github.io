Abilities
Transport: This model has a transport capacity of 14 ADEPTUS ASTARTES INFANTRY models. Each JUMP PACK, WULFEN, GRAVIS or TERMINATOR model takes up the space of 2 models and each CENTURION model takes up the space of 3 models.
Emergency Combat Embarkation: Once per turn, in your opponent’s Charge phase, after an enemy unit has selected targets for its charge but before it makes a Charge move, you can select one Adeptus Astartes unit from your army that was selected as a target of that charge. Provided that unit is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units and every model in that unit is within 3" of this Transport, it can embark within this Transport. The charging unit can then select new targets for its charge.
Damaged: 1-5 Wounds Remaining: While this model has 1-5 wounds remaining, each time this model makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
Rules
Deadly Demise D6: Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6").
Oath of Moment: If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, at the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next Command phase, that enemy unit is your Oath of Moment target. Each time a model with this ability makes an attack that targets your Oath of Moment target:
■ You can reroll the Hit roll
■ If your army does not include one or more units with the Black Templars, Blood Angels, Dark Angels, Deathwatch or Space Wolves keywords, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.
Indirect Fire: Weapons with [INDIRECT FIRE] in their profile are known as Indirect Fire weapons, and attacks can be made with them even if the target is not visible to the attacking model. These attacks can destroy enemy models in a target unit even though none may have been visible to the attacking unit when you selected that target.
If no models in a target unit are visible to the attacking unit when you select that target, then each time a model in the attacking unit makes an attack against that target using an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll, an unmodified Hit roll of 1-3 always fails, and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack. Weapons with the [TORRENT] ability cannot be fired using the [INDIRECT FIRE] ability.

One Shot: The bearer can only shoot with this weapon once per battle.
Sustained Hits: Weapons with [SUSTAINED HITS X] in their profile are known as Sustained Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if a Critical Hit is rolled, that attack scores a number of additional hits on the target as denoted by ‘x’
Twin-linked: Weapons with [TWIN-LINKED] in their profile are known as Twin-linked weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, you can re-roll that attack’s Wound roll.
Devastating Wounds: Weapons with [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] in their profile are known as Devastating Wounds weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if that attack scores a Critical Wound, no saving throw of any kind can be made against that attack (including invulnerable saving throws). Such attacks are only allocated to models after all other attacks made by the attacking unit have been allocated and resolved. After that attack is allocated and after any modifiers are applied, it inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that attack, instead of inflicting damage normally.

From Golden Light: Once per battle, at the end of your opponent's turn, if this unit is not whithin Engagement Range of one or more enemy units, you can remove it from the battlefield.

Rules
Deep Strike: During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.
If a unit with the Deep Strike ability arrives from Strategic Reserves, the controlling player can choose for that unit to be set up either using the rules for Strategic Reserves or using the Deep Strike ability.

Martial Ka'tah: Each time a unit with this ability is selected to fight, select one of the Ka'tah stances below. Until that unit has finished making its attacks, the selected Stance is active for it and it gains the relevant ability.
■ DACATARAI STANCE
Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.
■ RENDAX STANCE
Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

Blast: Weapons with [BLAST] in their profile are known as Blast weapons, and they make a random number of attacks. Each time you determine how many attacks are made with a Blast weapon, add 1 to the result for every five models that were in the target unit when you selected it as the target (rounding down). Blast weapons can never be used to make attacks against a unit that is within Engagement Range of one or more units from the attacking model’s army (including its own unit).
Assault: Weapons with [ASSAULT] in their profile are known as Assault weapons. If a unit that Advanced this turn contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn’s Shooting phase. When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its models are equipped with.

Deep Strike: During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.
If a unit with the Deep Strike ability arrives from Strategic Reserves, the controlling player can choose for that unit to be set up either using the rules for Strategic Reserves or using the Deep Strike ability.

The Shadow of Chaos: If your Army Faction is LEGIONES DAEMONICA, certain areas of the battlefield are considered to be within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, as follows:
■ Your deployment zone is always within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.
■ At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within No Man’s Land, until the end of that phase, No Man’s Land is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.
■ At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within your opponent’s deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your opponent’s deployment zone is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos.
DAEMONIC MANIFESTATION
While a LEGIONES DAEMONICA unit from your army is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, add 1 to that test and, if that test is passed, one model in that unit regains up to D3 lost wounds (if that unit is a BATTLELINE unit and that test is passed, up to D3 destroyed models can be returned to that unit instead).

DAEMONIC TERROR
While an enemy unit is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos and/or it is within 6" of one or more BLOODTHIRSTER, GREAT UNCLEAN ONE, KAIROS FATEWEAVER, KEEPER OF SECRETS, LORD OF CHANGE, ROTIGUS, SHALAXI HELBANE or SKARBRAND units from your army, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, subtract 1 from that test and, if that test is failed, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

Warp Rifts: Each time a LEGIONES DAEMONICA unit from your army is set up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike ability, if it is set up wholly within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, and/or if it is set up wholly within 6" of one or more friendly BLOODTHIRSTER, GREAT UNCLEAN ONE, KAIROS FATEWEAVER, KEEPER OF SECRETS, LORD OF CHANGE, ROTIGUS, SHALAXI HELBANE or SKARBRAND units with which it shares the KHORNE, TZEENTCH, NURGLE or SLAANESH keyword, it can be set up anywhere that is more than 6" horizontally away from all enemy models, instead of more than 9".
Infiltrators: During deployment, if every model in a unit has this ability, then when you set it up, it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone and all enemy models.
Lethal Hits: Weapons with [LETHAL HITS] in their profile are known as Lethal Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically wounds the target.

Abilities
Molten Form: Each time an attack is allocated to this model, halve the Damage characteristic of that attack
The Bloody Handed (Aura): While a friendly Aeldari unit is within 6" of this model, add 1 to Advance and Charge rolls made for that unit.
Damaged: 1-5 Wounds Remaining: While this model has 1-5 wounds remaining, each time this model makes an attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
Invulnerable Save: 4+
Rules
Deadly Demise D3: Some models have 'Deadly Demise x' listed in their abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a TRANSPORT, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by 'x' (if this is a random number, roll separately for each unit within 6").
Strands of Fate: If your Army Faction is AELDARI, at the start of the battle, make a Strands of Fate roll by rolling six D6.
If you wish, you can then re-roll all of these dice, but if you do, roll one less D6. You can continue re-rolling all of the dice in this manner, rolling one less D6 each time you do, until you are satisfied with the results rolled (or until you only have a single D6 remaining).

When you are satisfied with the results rolled, those remaining dice become your Fate dice for the battle. These results cannot be changed or re-rolled further, unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your Fate dice to one side – this is your Fate dice pool.

Once per phase, before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with the Strands of Fate ability, if you have one or more dice in your Fate dice pool, you can use one of those Fate dice. To do so, select one of those Fate dice to substitute that dice roll. The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the selected Fate dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules purposes). Each Fate dice can only be used in this way once. After using a Fate dice, remove it from your Fate dice pool and roll all remaining dice that are part of that dice roll (if any). You can use Fate dice for any of the following types of dice roll:
■ Advance roll
■ Battle-shock test
■ Charge roll
■ Damage roll
■ Hit roll
■ Saving throw
■ Wound roll

Sustained Hits: Weapons with [SUSTAINED HITS X] in their profile are known as Sustained Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if a Critical Hit is rolled, that attack scores a number of additional hits on the target as denoted by ‘x’

Abilities
Fear of the Unseen (Aura): While an enemy unit is within 6" of this model, worsen the Leadership characteristic of models in that unit by 1. In addition, in the Battle-shock step of your opponent’s Command phase, if such an enemy unit is below its Starting Strength, it must take a Battle-shock test.
Hunter Organism: This model cannot be your Warlord
Feeder Tendrils: Each time this model destroys an enemy Character model, you gain 1CP.
Invulnerable Save (4+): This model has a 4+ Invulnerable Save.
Rules
Fights First: Units with this ability that are eligible to fight do so in the Fights First step, provided every model in the unit has this ability.
Infiltrators: During deployment, if every model in a unit has this ability, then when you set it up, it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone and all enemy models.
Lone Operative: Unless part of an Attached Unit, this unit can only be selected as the target of a ranged attack if the attacking model is within 12".
Stealth: If every model in a unit has this ability, then each time a ranged attack is made against it, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll.
Synapse: If your Army Faction is TYRANIDS, while a TYRANIDS unit from your army is within 6" of one or more friendly SYNAPSE models, that TYRANIDS unit is said to be within Synapse Range of that model and of your army. While a Tyranids unit from your army is within Synapse Range of your army:
■ Each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, take that test on 3D6 instead of 2D6.
■ Each time a model in that unit makes a melee attack, add 1 to the Strength characteristic of that attack.

Precision: Weapons with [PRECISION] in their profile are known as Precision weapons. Each time an attack made with such a weapon successfully wounds an Attached Unit, if a Character model in that unit is visible to the attacking model, the attacking model’s player can choose to have that attack allocated to that Character model instead of following the normal attack sequence.
